To run the simply execute ACL.py

If you wish to change the running condiditions, all you need to do is open ACL.py and go to the main method
located at the very bottom.

Once there you run the program with the engine = ACL('A1/extendedAcl', 'A1/extendedPackets', 'extended')
if you wish to change the type of ACL rules, change the path of the first argument (i.e 'A1/acl')
if you wish to change the packets used, change the path of the second argument (i.e 'A1/packets')
if you wish to run the ACL as standard (not extended) use 'standard' for the third argument, obviously 'extended' makes it run in extended mode.

Please do not provide incorrect input, the file should be written as the sample ones located in the A1 directory.

Thank you!
