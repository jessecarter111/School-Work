A proof of concept for a Polyphase Interpolation and Decimation filter for my final co-op. This was ultimately implemented in the production codebase and extended
the lifetime of the hardware by saving over 10% CPU usage on filtering operations! Note several files are missing from the implementation as they are proprietary and not for
public access :(
