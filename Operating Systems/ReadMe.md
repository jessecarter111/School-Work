Very challenging term project from my Operating Systems course. Throughout the semester we were tasked with incrementally building a "Virtual" OS by simulating one in C. 
This included things like building a kernel to perform bitwise operations, a handler for IO/Devices, a virtual and physical memory system and many more components. The OS 
even has its own machine language which can be used to build programs and run through the OS. Big shoutout to DR. ALEX BRODSKY for creating such an interesting and challenging
project!!
