The reason this is a valid test of the cpunum instruction is because it will print the total number of running threads ("cpus" in the case of Xsim) each time a thread executes an instruction. The number of total threads running should be consistant accross all the cpu_prints as the total number of cpus is decided when the XSIM is started. Like the cpuid test, another instruction is executed after cpunum to insure the correct cpunum is still being displayed.
